# PatftBot
This is a Firefox extension providing group written description review of assets at http://patft.uspto.gov/

Attorneys, patent agents, and engineers regularly have to review large groups of patent assets (e.g., for licensing, for purchase, etc.).  Collaboratively reviewing and relating the results of such reviews can be difficult.  For example, the results of a review may be contained in a morass of emails, Excel files, Word files, and printed notes.  Quickly iterating over and considering comments for 50+ assets in such situations can be very difficult.

Some tools almost fulfill this need.  For example, Google Patents allows you to select keywords, but it does not accommodate collaborative review.  Similarly, there are web markup tools available for adding comments to webpages, but these are not designed for patent practitioners.  PATFTBOT focuses *specifically* on patent review in the deeper 112/Phillips context.

A good place to start is by reviewing the [PATFTBOT_Instructions_Demo_Walkthrough.pdf](PATFTBOT_Instructions_Demo_Walkthrough.pdf).

IMPORTANT: PATFTBOT v1.0 was written under very significant time constraints (May 2019).  Accordingly, one should expect significant bug fixes and feature updates as it evolves before becoming a streamlined, production-grade tool.

IMPORANT:  Also note that the license is AGPL since, like PATFT itself, improvements should be publicly available.
